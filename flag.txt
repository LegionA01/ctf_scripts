-> $# => to all variable directories in which we want to search
-> $0 => script name likewise $1 = first argument "string to search", $2 => first directory(2nd argument) and so on...
-> shift => due to this action, just think as we have removed $1("string to search") postion and now 'this means $2 becomes $1 and $3 becomes $2 and so on...
-> $@ => iterate direcory one by one
-> 2>/dev/null => don't show error if occures
